>The basic problems that we might encounter are no internet access or poor internet connection, failed to scan the photo due to the camera itself of the user.

**Describe the possible solutions:**

>Installation of more modem for wider connectivity in the premises or avail a data subscription. Invest in a better phone with better camera or clean the lenses properly.

>*Low-cost upgrade* - Cheapest upgrade as possible.

>*Internet* – must be 3mbps minimum connection

>*Maintainability* – must be easy to maintain

>*Effectivity* – must be effective and working, effect is significantly noticeable

**Propose with the Feasible Solution:**

>Modem can cost around 2000 pesos, it allows us to have a wider coverage of internet connection, and it can handle more users.
