                   skill and intelligence, perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized 
                   the Renaissance humanist ideal. His Last Supper (1495–98) and Mona Lisa (c. 1503–19) 
                   are among the most widely popular and influential paintings of the Renaissance.

                   generally considered the greatest after Rembrandt van Rijn, and one of the greatest 
                   of the Post-Impressionists. The striking colour, emphatic brushwork, and contoured 
                   forms of his work powerfully influenced the current of Expressionism in modern art. 
                   Van Gogh’s art became astoundingly popular after his death, especially in the late 20th century, 
                   when his work sold for record-breaking sums at auctions around the world and was featured 
                   in blockbuster touring exhibitions. In part because of his extensive published letters, 
                   van Gogh has also been mythologized in the popular imagination as the quintessential tortured artist.."
