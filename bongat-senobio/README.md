# FurniShop AR: An Augmented Reality Product  Viewer for Online Furniture Shop Using WebXR

## Product Description

FurniShop AR is a platform that uses augmented reality technology to visualize the products of an online furniture store. It allows the user to explore the sense of the scale of each product and its appearance. The customers can explore the product by viewing it through their camera and projecting it onto their environment. Thus, this will help buyers decide whether they want to purchase the product or not. Besides, this will also help the business to promote their sales and deliver a quality product.

## Market Analysis

This platform will be beneficial, especially for those users who prefer browsing online shops without leaving the comfort of their homes. FurniShop AR provides an augmented reality feature for the FurniShop online website, making it the best option for the large scale of unique designs and quality products.

## Technical Specifications

FurniShop AR is a product viewer that helps users view the products online shop businesses offer.

## Risk Analysis

The lack of 3d assets which would depict the products accurately would be problematic. Also, the variabilities of the specifications of users' devices would prove to be a challenge as it will affect the accuracy and tracking of the AR Camera and the scaling of the 3d object. The potential customers need to be technologically aware of modern technology so it will be easier for them to use the augmented reality feature. However, it will not limit the user's capacity to browse the online shop.

## Describe the Possible Solutions

The FurniShop AR was made to provide a convenient purchasing experience for potential customers of furniture with a 3d experience. The lack of 3d assets will not be a problem anymore. FurniShop utilizes different 3d sources and integrates GL Transmission Format Binary File (glb) assets. In addition, FurniShop has its manual to make it easier for customers who are new to using this kind of feature. It was built with buttons to manipulate 3d models using the camera quickly. The following buttons below are created with different functions:

View in AR button – to access the product viewer.
Lock button – to lock the position of the furniture and avoid extra movement.
Left-Right buttons – to rotate the model.
Stop button – to stop the AR experience after viewing the product.

## Evaluation Criteria

The development of the FurniShop AR considered the following criteria:

### 1. Relevance

People usually buy their products online since it is convenient and will not consume much time. Customers often wonder what the sizes of the actual volume of the product they bought online are. FurniShop AR is developed to address this kind of issue. Besides, this product viewer will be essential to determining the perfect choice of furniture. Also, it will lessen the chance of choosing the wrong furniture sizes and help the shopping website to lessen possible product returns.

### 2. Effectiveness and Accuracy

Online Shopping websites use images and product information of the furniture they sell online. However, after selling the product, some sellers receive negative feedback from the customers because customers mostly misinterpret the actual size or appearance of the product they bought. The feature of this product viewer effectively addresses misconceptions about the furniture product sizes, and this will also help the shop to present its product with accuracy.

### 3. User Experience 

Images are not enough to determine whether what you see online is real. Some customers tend to have trust issues regarding online products since they cannot physically see them. FurniShop AR ensures that the FurniShop online shopping website visitors will have a great experience. The 3d feature of the product viewer will be a great advantage in attracting more customers.

### 4. Navigation and Design

People tend to use user-friendly shopping websites that are set up so they can easily shop online. The product viewer is designed to help customers to navigate the product quickly. Also, some buttons will serve as a guide for the customers to access the 3d experience easily. 

## Propose with the Feasible Solution

Developing the product viewer will significantly help promote local furniture products from different areas. However, it will not cost much for the seller to spend much money maintaining the product viewer with the 3d feature on their site. The product viewer will not need a monthly payment to access the 3d feature; this is the best way to promote the furniture product without renting an apartment to sell the furniture. Besides, the customers will also benefit since they will no longer need to spend money visiting the shop. It only means that fuel consumption will lessen, which is a significant indicator of avoiding extra costs. On the other hand, FurniShop AR, a product viewer, is software that can be accessed using smartphones. However, the software cannot access critical information using smartphones, and it is safe, and all the model resources are available on the internet.

## Conclusion 

This project aims to develop a product viewer that will address the product misconceptions, negative feedback, and negative buying experience that affects both the customers and seller. The product development considered the four criteria: relevance, effectiveness and accuracy, user experience, and navigation and design. These criteria are utilized to address the possible risk that the software may face in the future. Also, this was to improve the technological and economic aspect of promoting local furniture brands.
