## Risk Analysis

The lack of 3d assets which would depict the products accurately would be problematic. Also, the variabilities of the specifications of usersâ€™ devices would prove to be a challenge as it will affect the accuracy and tracking of the AR Camera and the scaling of the 3d object. The potential customers need to be technologically aware of modern technology so it will be easier for them to use the augmented reality feature. However, it will not limit the capacity of the user in browsing the online shop.

## Describe the Possible Solutions

In addition, FurniShop has its manual to make it easier for customers who are new to using this kind of feature. It was built with buttons to manipulate 3d models using the camera quickly.
