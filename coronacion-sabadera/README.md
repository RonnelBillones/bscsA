LeARn: A Web Augmented Reality for Learning Body Organs
======
### Project Description
This project helps the student to learn the different Body Organs, where  a 3d form of the organs can be seen up close. In this way students can have an engaging and fun learning experience. Through the use of web AR, it uses a camera to scan an image marker and then the 3d model of the organ will show up with a sound that explains the brief information about the different organs. 
### Market Analysis
Our observations suggest that students nowadays engage more in learning that looks fun for them and draw more attention to those that they find entertaining. Most kids also prefer using gadgets more than books. This project aims to provide fun learning for the young students like in elementary. It will also help the teachers because they can use our project to improve their teaching approach to students.
### Technical Specifications
LeARn is made for students to learn about different body organs through the use of WebAR they can interact with 3d models using gestures. The user can access these models by scanning the image markers using the camera on their devices. It works well with smartphones and computers (with cameras attached). As of now, the interactions to the 3d models are just limited to zooming and rotating but we will provide future updates according to feedback given by the users. 
### Risk Analysis
After some thorough analysis and tests, we discovered that this application might have compatibility issues on some devices. Since it requires camera and internet connection to operate, errors with scanning can also take place depending on the camera quality and the app might not be accessible to some places that have poor connection or no internet at all. Also, each body organ is not all included due to the difficulty of finding all of its 3D models and also it is hard to find each marker that has a good quality image. In addition,some teachers, especially the elderlies are not so knowledgeable about technology and they could face some difficulties in using our application.
### Describe Possible Solutions
1. Making the application work offline - By making it offline it will be easier to use by some students especially those who live in a remote area.
2. Using markers with less details - Markers with less details and good quality images can be scanned easily and it saves a lot of time in scanning them.
3. Combine all the 3D models of the organ in one marker - By showing these body organs in one marker can be fun to see, as it is like seeing our body inside.
4. Creating a user manual to guide the teachers and students. - The manual is there to guide and help the students and teachers on how the application works. 
### Evaluation Criteria
1. Effectiveness - Students learn about the different body organs.
2. Efficiency - The application consumes less time and effort to prepare and operate.
3. User Interaction - The system responds accurately and fast with the user’s gestures.
4. Relevance - The information presented is up to date.
### Propose with the Feasible Solution
With the given possible solutions, we assessed these by rating it on a scale of 1-4. And we’ve come up with the idea that combining all the 3D models of the organ in one marker and creating a user manual would be the best things to do for now. But we are still considering making our application work offline in the near future.

### Conclusion
This project aims to develop a fun and engaging learning about body organs. It would make students have interest in their lesson. Students are most likely to accept this learning style because they find using gadgets more entertaining. And with listing all of the possible solutions for this project, solution 3 combining all the 3D models of the organ in one marker and solution 4 creating a user manual to guide the teachers and students has the most total points when we evaluate it. To conclude, the  most feasible solution for now is combining all the 3D models of the organ in one marker because students will be able to visualize what it looks like inside our body. And making a user's manual would be effective to learn the application easily by young students and teachers.
